# Singleton Pattern

[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern)

In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.
